# Hi everyone, and welcome to this section.

# This section is a bit different from everything we've done so far, so this is just a course catch up.
# And what do I mean by a course catch up?
# Well, this is just a single lecture where we are going to speak a bit about where we are right now and where we are going in the course.

# So what we've learned so far is basically learning the fundamentals of R.
#   We've learned a lot of objects.
#   We've learned how to index and modify those objects.
#   We've learned the difference between the data types and how these objects interact with these data types.
#   And we've also learned what a uni dimensional or a multi-dimensional object really means.

# These fundamental concepts are super important when you start to code in R, because this fundamental knowledge is what will enable you to be a better programmer and it will enable you to cut corners when you find mistakes.
# If we don't understand these fundamentals and all the fundamental objects that we've worked until so far, you will probably have a hard time in understanding some of the coding parts that we'll do from now on.

# So making the jump between what we've seen and what we will do from now on.
# We have seen theoretical examples until now because it's not expected that you as a data analyst or as a data scientist, create your own data with the list command, with the C command, or even with the DataFrame command.
# Mostly what you do in real life is to read data from other systems or work with databases that are already in R.

# That's why from now on we will start to do more applied stuff.

# So we'll start to deal with real problems that people face when they are working with R and R. Sections will be based on that.
#   We will see statistics.
#   We'll see how we can work and load data files.
#   We will see an example of how we can work with real Walmart data just for you to see how we can go around and think about the problems that we have that we'll try to solve by using data.
# So everything from now on will be a bit more applied.

# That's the main difference between what we've done until now and how we'll go in the future in the course.

# So take a breathe, really study the fundamentals, make sure that you've understood everything until now, because now we are going to jump into a more applied part.
